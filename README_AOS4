Notes:
======

Welcome to MPlayer, The Movie Player.

MPlayer can play most standard video formats out of the box and almost all the others with the help of external codecs.

MPlayer currently works best from the command line, but visual feedback for many functions is available from its onscreen status display (OSD), which is also used for displaying subtitles.

MPlayer for AmigaOS4 is currently based on MPlayer 1.5 (w/ FFmpeg 6.1.1), merging code from LiveForIt-MPlayer, MickJT-MPlayer and the Andrea Palmatè's MPlayer ports, with various additional changes and improvements.

The default settings in the config file will degrade the video quality in order to decrease the CPU usage.


Credits:
========

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the development of MPlayer; Jörg Strohmayer, Andrea Palmatè, Kjetil Hvalstrand, Daniel Westerberg, Roman Kargin, Fabien Coeurjoly,
Javier de Las Rivas, DET Nicolas, MickJT, Marek, Diego Biurrum, Felix Bunemann, Ryan C. Fordon and many more.

Thanks also to pjs, sundown, K-L, AmigaSociety, mbrantley, ktadd, Mason, Samo79 and many others for testing and contributions.


Know problems:
==============

* Incorrect display size when entering fullscreen if using custom AutoScroll dimensions on Workbench screen
* OSD menu may crash if used with playlist or when quit
* AHI: Wav audio files noises if using AHI output driver, they works fine with -ao sdl
* ARexx: Stay paused if using MPlayer-GUI and paused outside of it (pausing get_time_pos)
* SDL: Support for SDL12-Compat need to be fixed (compatibility layer for SDL2)
* SDL/GL: Windows cannot be deiconified from AppIcon if previously they were iconified from the Exchanger commodity
* SDL/GL: Fullscreen gadget may be implemented
* SDL/GL: Menu may be implemented
* Comp: Videos are not correctly centered on screen if opened into another separated screen
* Amiga: Auto Aspect Ratio need to be reimplemented
* CGX_WPA: Video scaling support need to be reimplemented
* PIP: Fullscreen support need to be reimplemented
* P96_pip: Background color problem when starting videos (bug in ATIRadeon.chip: it always opens a YUV pixel format instead of R5G6B5)
* P96_pip: Problems with HD videos (for ex. 1920x1080 videos show a stripe in the right area of the video)

	* Fix: FFmpeg 2.5 (64 Bit fix)

MPlayer 6.5 (MPlayer 1.1.1)
	* New: Menus

MPlayer 6.4 (MPlayer 1.1.1) - LiveForIt (14.01.2015)
	* Added NODMA and NODRI option for Comp_yuv.c and Comp_yuv2.c
	* Removed debug output from:
	  stream.c, cache2.c, mplayer.c, vo_comp_yuv.c, vo_comp_yuv2.c
	* Formatted some text in:
	  ao_ahi_dev.c
	* Replaced PIP video output with P96_pip video output
	* Fixed OSD for CGX_WPA
	* Fixed SDL video output, window mode now is default
	* Fixed a bug in vo_comp_yuv.c, colors where not copied correctly
	  If the picture was drawn by 16 pixels slices of the height,
	  (y offset was ignored), instead of by frame or DRI
	* Fixed ARexx dead lock issue (for MPlayer-GUI)

MPlayer 6.3 (MPlayer 1.1.1)
	* Removed GetBitMapAttr( bm, BMA_Width ) does not work with new libs
	* Small changes in codec buffer to ram bitmap copy routines
	  Now use MemCopyQuick() instead of MemCopy()

MPlayer 6.2 (MPlayer 1.1.1)
	* Fixed a bug that can crash MPlayer when its started in vo_comp_yuv.c
	* Solved an audio/video sync problem with video by threading vo_comp_yuv.c
	  Because of the amount of data needed to process in the page_flip,
	  plus the wait for vertical blanker in MPlayer slows down the video decoding,
	  MPlayer can now use the CPU power it has more efficient, this can result in
	  higher CPU load, but should improve playback on high definition video
	* New version of Comp_yuv is now Comp_yuv2, I kept the old one for testing
	  See -vo help, for more info
	  Note: The extra complexity can make vo look slower on some benchmarks,
	  vc speed should have increased in speed, (but benchmarks are unrealistic
	  because they do more OSD and PAGE_FLIPS then when you run it normally)
	* Comp_yuv2: Fixed OSD text rendering bug when video support direct rendering
	* Replaced more of 32bit off_t (offset type) shit by replacing it with int64_t,
	  1000 of placed in the code, this should not be needed if the SDK supported
	  #define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64 (please add support for it in the SDK)
	  I hope large file support has been improved
	* Comp is now clean from CyberGfx and Picasso96 stuff
	  Now only use graphics.library (min. graphics.library version is now 54, RectFillColor needs it)
	* DVD: Disabled output window
	* DVD: Removed some silly debug text

MPlayer 6.1 (MPlayer 1.1.1)
	* Comp_yuv: Fixed green line on top of window/screen
	* Fixed problem finding all screen modes
	* Tried to increase the AHI buffer (hope audio gets better)
	* Rewrote args for video outputs
	  (vo:help now supported)
	* Fixed support for multiple monitors
	  vo:monitor=0 is for first monitor, 
	  vo:monitor=1 is for second monitor
	* Comp_yuv, comp & CGX_WPA now respect monitor nr.
	  (Sorry don't think this can be done for overlay PIP / p96_pip)
	* Comp_yuv: Now respects -monitoraspect command line argument
	* Comp_yuv: Default monitor aspect is now taken for named public screen, 
	  If your using vo:pubscreen=dopus.1 (in case you have two monitors) 
	  (else its taken from Workbench screen, like before)

MPlayer 6.0 (MPlayer 1.1.1)
	* Fixed green line on top of videos
	* New MPlayer source code from MPlayerHQ (http://www.mplayerhq.hu)
	  See MPlayerHQ.changelog for more information about changes from HQ
	  (Most important replaced AAC codec, no more crashes)
	* New FFmpeg 2.2
	  See FFmpeg changelog for more informations
	* Fixed Direct Rendering (DR) support added to Comp_yuv, some codecs will use DR,
	  this improve speed by moving less data around (some problems with subtitles)
	* Fixed MPEG codec, so that DR works with interleaved yuv420p bitmaps
	  (MPEG codec expects non interleaved yuv420p bitmaps and check bpr)
	* Added Prefetch buffer to prevent inefficiency in IO device of AmigaOS4
	  (This fixed slow DVD read speed)
	* Ported AHI_DEV to version 1.1.1, changed timeing, and reduced buffer size
	  (Done to fix lip sync issue)

	* Swapped vo_overlay and vo_cgx video drivers. Now it is possible to use MPlayer only with filename

MPlayer 1.0 Pre6 Dirty Preview #4 (24.03.2005)
	These are the major improvements:

	* First of all the speed: You can notice a speed increased of a 25-30%. This thanks to the new Olaf Barthel's clib2-thread safe
	* New video and audio drivers:
	  -vo sdl
	  -ao sdl
	  -vo jpg
	  -vo png
	  The SDL video drivers allow to see video at fullscreen without problems. The only problem is that the video driver starts in fullscreen mode by default. If you press 'f' key it switches on Window Mode. This driver allow to cycle the WB screen modes by pressing 'c' key. So when in fullscreen, if you wanna change the screen resolution just press the key
	  The SDL driver in fullscreen resolution (the first resolution) is slow because there is no hardware acceleration (no overlay, you know? ;-) ). So switch to window mode or change resolution
	  The SDL audio drivers works like AHI driver. You can mix video and audio drivers as you want
	  For example:
	  -vo cgx_vmem -ao sdl
	  -vo sdl -ao ahi
	  and so on...
	  The JPG and PNG drivers write the selected video on single frames in the video directory. So you can save the video in single frames. They cannot be used with other video and audio drivers. Just:
	  mplayer -vo png Drive:video.avi
	* Network Audio and Video streaming: Now it is possible to use the audio and video streaming by simply using this syntax:
	  mplayer http://www.mystreamingsite.com[:port]
	  or better:
	  mplayer -playlist http://www.mystreamingsite.com[:port]/mylist.pls
	  Look that many site has other extension than pls. Even ASP or PHP (with parameters included) pages can be viewed with -playlist option
	* Playlist support the -playlist option is useful when you want to use a playlist file. Just edit files with songs or videos filename
	  Example:
	  list >ram:myplaylist.txt Video: LFORMAT %f%s
	  mplayer -playlist ram:myplaylist.txt -vo sdl
	* New codecs supported
	* And many other improvements and bug fixes
	  The known bugs:
	  - When you use SDL video driver and in the system is not present a large enough resolution, the video driver doesn't start. So it is recommended to create in the Picasso96 a large resolution
	  - If you wanna use CGX video drivers and want a fullscreen video that fill the entire screen, you must create on Picasso96 mode a resolution that has the same video width (and height). This because the CGX video is buggy... and i'm working on it
	  - Some DVD's reader signal a GetBusykey error. Please report to me the model
	  - There are surely many other bugs. So please report to me

MPlayer 1.0 Pre6 Dirty Preview #3 (1.02.2005)
	* Two new output drivers
	  -vo_jpeg
	  -vo_png
	  That allow to save a video into a single frames (JPEG and PNG respectively)
	* MPlayer is now compiled with the new thread safe clib2 by Olaf Barthel
	* DVD Playing
	  The DVD can be viewed with:
	  -dvd-device a1ide.device:x dvd://1
	* VCD Playing
	  -cdrom-device a1ide.device:x vcd://1
